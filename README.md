# Human Sync Lab

This project is a work in progress. The idea behind this project is to explore ways on linking personal health data (provided via Garmin Health API) with AI to create meaningful insights and interactions.

## Privary Draft

This project is currently in development. If granted Garmin Connect Developer access, all user data will be handled in compliance with GDPR and other applicable privacy laws.

No personal data is collected, stored, or processed at this time.

Any future access to data will occur only with explicit user consent via Garmin&apos;s authorization system. A full privacy policy will be published prior to any public release or before data collection begins.
